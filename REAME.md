# Principles of Electrical Engineering Design Website

Basic site based off of Google's material design lite javascript/css framework. Site will be used to track progress throughout the semester on our senior design project and lab work that needs to be completed.

Site will be published at eedesign.klinker.xyz. Jenkins will perform continuous integration to publish the site within 15 minutes of a change being made.
