                      For lab 3, we are going to make an Android to enable secure communication. The benefits for this is that we can use a few different OOB communication methods to exchange public keys between users (SMS and email) and we will get practice for next semester where we will be making an app for Source Allies.<br/><br/>
                      We have already created the messaging backend and interface for the application, the next step will be to write the actual encryption and then we'll be set!

                      Even though we are getting garbage bits in between our start and stop flags, we still need to continue moving through the lab incase we can't fix those, so that we still get as many parts done as possible. So, we now read the bits into a buffer (even if the data isn't correct) and then convert that buffer to ASCII codes and output these codes over the serial interface. We also perform the CRC check on what we generate for these received bits and compare it to the received CRC code.<br/><br/>
                      Since we get garbage in between our start and stop sequences, we never actually expect the CRC check to be OK, but we do it anyways so as to be as complete as possible. The same goes for bit stuffing, we process stuffed bits correctly and kick out the extra ones, but it still doesn't help us get the correct data.

                      After we read the tone wave, we need to process the bits from it and determine where the start and end flags are at. We accomplished this through the zero-crossing algorithm outlined on ICON and can now read these bits correctly.<br/><br/>
                      
                      When reading what is in between them however, we start to run into problems. We are just getting garbage bits in between that do not convert to ASCII codes at all and are currently unsure why this is.

                      The next step was to generate a tone wave from the level shifted and inverted data and this is now complete. We accomplished this on the Arduino using simple pin interrupts that fired whenever the level shifted wave went from positive to negative or negative to positive and then compared the amount of time that this took to 1700Hz.

                      We need to get the data in the correct format so that we are able to process it. First, we send data through an AUX cable and this gives us a sine wave with frequencies of 1200Hz and 2200Hz intermittedly. From there, we need to level shift and invert the wave and then turn that square wave into a tone wave that we can read data from. We were able to level shift and invert with a simple comparitor hardware piece and can now move onto the software portion of the project.

                      Lab 2 work has started now and the first step that we have taken is creating a simple C++ program that can calculate the CRC for integers that we give it. This will be easily translatable into Arduino code that can be executed to generate a CRC from received data and check it against the received CRC to ensure that we are receiving the correct values.<br/><br/>

                      This will be implemented into the lab after we reach the stage where we need it.

                      We have now combined all of the different pieces of the project and are running the final tests to ensure correctness, the project is almost done now. One problem that we ran into that we don't think we'll be able to fix: the arduino cannot connect to the school's WiFi network due to processing power constraints. We attempted to connect it to a hotspot, but unfortunately for unknown reasons the requests did not go through on the hotspot.<br/><br/>

                      The WiFi does work when connected to our apartment internet connection, requests go through and can be seen on the website, but it would not work when we connected to the hotspot, so unfortunately this means we cannot demo the WiFi aspect of the project to the TA/professor. It will have to be two different parts unfortunately, the hardware with LED array and power switch and the software backend/website with a software client posting fake values to it. This is better than nothing at least.

                      After creating the client to fill the data, we wanted to be able to view those temperatures. We set up a basic webpage to just display the current temperature and get new values for it every one second.<br/><br/>

                      Our web client is simple HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We used Google's Material Design Lite for responsive design, similar to this class website. The page gets rendered, then, then Javascript fills the current temperature field.<br/><br/> 

                      Note that this page will display 'Data Unavailable' if the backend says there is no temperature reading. So, unless the client is running and filling the values, or our temperature sensor is actually turned on, this web client will not do anything.<br/><br/>

                      First step in any good project group is creating a cool website and hosting it yourself in your apartment... Hopefully the internet doesn't go down so we can always see it!<br/><br/>
